Notes
I couldn't get the form display to work, actually taking in user input via a form and passing it from one page to the next.
However, I was able to make the calls and retrieve the data, so I simply hardcoded the inputs in each of these pages to serve
as a sample.

Urls:
localhost:8000/weather - is our landing page which is just valuable to confirm that the service is running
localhost:8000/weather/search - is the would-be form page wherein we'd take in a user zipcode. (Currently hardcoded)
localhost:8000/weather/results - is the follow-up page which would take the lat and long received from the /search to fire off
                                 a second request to retrieve the weather results for the day
localhost:8000/weather/fiveday - is the page we created in the live-coding session
